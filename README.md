# EEE3096SProject-A
Objective for Mini Project A and B is to design an environment logger. An environment
logger interacts with the world around it by measuring any number of factors from GPS
location to air pollution. While a single sensor is useful to monitor a single location, many
can be scattered around a broader area to monitor that area as well as any patterns emerging
in that broader area.
